# Recap

::: recap
-   **`{ggplot2}`** is a powerful library for reproducible graphic design
-   the components follow a consistent syntax
-   each ggplot needs at least **data**, some **aesthetics**, and a **layer**
-   we **set** constant propeties outside `aes()`
-   ... and **map** data-related properties inside `aes()`
-   local settings and mappings override global properties
-   grouping allows applying layers for subsets
-   we can store a ggplot object and extend it afterwards
-   we can change the appearance for all plots with `theme_set()` and `theme_update()`

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

::: question
-   Open the script [`exercises/02_concepts_pt1_ex1.qmd`](../materials/exercises/02_concepts_pt1_ex1.qmd) (or the `.rmd`).
-   Explore the TfL bike share data visually:<br>**create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    -   Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    -   Connect the points of each period with lines.
    -   Question: What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.

## Exercise 2

::: question
-   Open the script [`exercises/02_concepts_pt1_ex2.qmd`](../materials/exercises/02_concepts_pt1_ex2.qmd) (or the `.rmd`).
-   Explore the TfL bike sharing data visually:<br>**create a boxplot of counts per weather type**
    -   Turn the plot into a jitter strips plot (random noise across the x axis)
    -   Combine both chart types (jittered points on top of the boxplots)
    -   [Bonus: Sort the boxplot-jitter hybrid by median counts]{style="color:#5DB699;font-weight:bold;"}
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
    -   [Bonus: Explore other chart types to visualize the distributions.]{style="color:#5DB699;font-weight:bold;"}
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.
