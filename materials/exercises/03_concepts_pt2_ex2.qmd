# Exercise 2

- Create a circular lollipop plot of reported bike shares per season.
    * The data is not in the right format as there are no totals.<br>How can you solve it?
    * Remove all legend elements (with a single line of code).
    * How can you add the labels next to the starting point of each lollipop?
    * How could you add a baseline?

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```

***Don't know where to start?*** In the folder `img/3-2-circular-lollipop` you'll find step-by-step charts.

## Circular Lollipop

```{r}
#| label: plot

```

  
  
  
  
```{r}
#| label: i-am-done-what-now
knitr::include_graphics("img/exercise-what-now-sd.png")
```
