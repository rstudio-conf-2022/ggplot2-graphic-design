**Create a similar visualization at the one placed in `exercises/7-1-bikes-jitter` as close as possible:**

![A sina plot combined with an errorbar of reported bike shares in London during day and night times, split by season, using TfL bike sharing data from 2015 to 2016."](../exercises/7-1-bikes-jitter/jittered-errorbars.png)

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)
library(ggforce)
library(ggtext)

bikes <- readr::read_csv(
  here::here("data", "london-bikes-custom.csv"), 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- forcats::fct_inorder(bikes$season)

colors <- c("#987708", "#663399")
```
